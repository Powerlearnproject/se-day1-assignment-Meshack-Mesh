Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is defined as the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools  to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
Software engineeringplays a crucial role in the technology industry by endabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainemnt and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Key milestones include the development of programminglanguages such as C, the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - This involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design - This is the creation of high-level and detailed designs of the software according to the design specifications.
Implementation- This is the actual writing of the code and building software according to the design specifications
Testing - Involves conducting a set of tests on thedeveloped software to ensure that it meets the requred quality standards and requirements.
Deployment- At this stage the software is released to users or customers.
Maintanance- Providing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

 
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall and Agile methodologies are both used to deliver a succesful project that meets user needs.
They both use different approaches to achieve towards the same goal. While waterfall uses a sequential approach with distinct phases sucha s requiremetns collection, designing flowing downwards like a watefall, Agile uses incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and rsponding to change.
The project duration for Waterfall method is Longer and Fixed while that of the Agile methodology is Shorter and Variable.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing code and iplemneting software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures quality by designing and executing test plans.
A Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code such as Visual Studio
Version Control Systems are software tools for tracking changes to source code and cordinating software quality.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements- some user requiremets may change during the development sycle, leading to scope crep and project delays. One strategy for solution is adoption of agile metholodoly which is flexible enough to user needs. Also ther eis need to be in constant communication with the users of the system. 
Tight deadlines. Pressure to deliver software producsts on schedule can result in rushed dvelopments and compromised quality. This can be dealt by prioritizing tasks, staying schedule and breakig down the tasks in various sections.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- It focuses on testing indivual components or functions of a software application in isolation. The tests are meant to ensure that each part of the software works correctly, helps identofy bugs early in development and faciliate code maintenance.
Integration Testing- This test verifies that different units or modules work togethre correctly when combined. it is useful in detecting issues related todata flow and communication between the components.
System Testing - It evaluates he complete and fully integrated software application against specified requirements. Ensures that the entire system behaves as expected in real world scenarios and identify system-wide issues before deployment.
Acceptance Testing- Done to determine whether the systemmeets business anduser requiremetns and is ready for deployment. It is important so as to ensure that the software meets the end user's needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is about crafting questions or stements to get the best possible respones from AI models.
It helps in making clear and specific questions and to avoid confusion as it clearly understands what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
 Vague Prompt- Write about technology
 Improved Prompt- Write a 500-word article on how artificial inteligence is transforming halthcare industry, including examples of AI applications in diagnosis, treatment, and patient care.
 The imporved prompt is has a more clear focus on the topic of discussion and has a speciifc scope that is diagnostics, treatment and patient care. It is also concise and direct.
